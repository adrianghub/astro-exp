As a software developer with 3 years of experience in the industry, I have a strong understanding of the JavaScript language working on commercial projects using React and Angular.
I have a basic understanding of backend development with NodeJS (Express, NestJS) and experience working with AWS, Docker, and CI/CD.

I've also worked in Scrum environments and have experience as a technical recruiter. In addition I hosted a couple of internal JS campanies.

I am a well-rounded professional with a mix of technical and recruitment experience, always looking to improve and enhance my skillset. A team player who is dedicated to delivering quality results. Throughout my dev growth, I'm successively adopting pragmatic & reliable solutions to encountered challenges.
